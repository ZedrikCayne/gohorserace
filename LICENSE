Any use of this project to do evil is prohibited. Definitions of evil
include stuff like missile guidance systems, world dominance, coup efforts,
pushing old folks down stairs, that kind of jazz.

Seriously, don't.

Any use of this project in the medical field or financial field is
prohibited. The authors don't want to have that on their conscience
when it inevitably fails and causes a pacemaker to freak out or through
some odd freak of nature turns your portfolio into penny stocks.

Seriously, don't.

Any use of this project in a production environment is a bad idea.
We won't stop you but the authors seriously doubt you will want to
and assume zero responsibility for any costs incurred. Seriously
we're putting this together on the weekends and evenings. See the
above MIT Licence bit for the more legal-ese version of this paragraph.

Seriously, don't.

If you're making money using this software, good! Throw some the
authors way. But see the comment above about not using this in
production. There are real versions of this hastily put together
software out there.

That's it. Now go make something. (Or don't...I'm not your boss/
responsible adult)
