Pull requests welcome, but your friendly maintainer doesn't have a
huge amount of time to deal with such things.

Spelling errors in bunches of places are intentional, pull requests
that just fix spelling and grammar in the code will be summarilly
binned.

Pearl clutching about not having proper separation between public
and private methods, not using accessors, etc...will be merged in
if it doesn't break anything.

Bug fixes and enhancements? Come right on in! This thing works well
enough for the use case to which it was created, but if you needed
to add something and it works? It's welcome.

All contributions should be considered under the same umbrella as the
license file is intended. "Here, have this thing...it works, you might
find it useful, and if you start to make a zillion dollars don't forget
to pass some on, and for the love of god don't sue me!"

If you add something that has a license add the licence to the
ThirdPartyLicenses folder, whose contents are automatically appended
into the output and print when you ask for the --license when starting up.

Other than that, have at it.
